# README

WELCOME Hello and thank you for visiting my Capstone project for the Flatiron School. My name is AlgorithmicJason and you are visiting my full-stack application called MyBrain.

IDEA BEHIND MYBRAIN The reason for making this application is because i needed a tool to remember little details in programming that i might not use everyday. MyBrain helps me track what i've learned and forever save it to my 'virtual memory' for example when learning code for the first time it could be easy to mix up standards between the different programming languages, but with MyBrain you can always be sure your information is correct.

FEATURES When using MyBrain you will be able to activate your own brain and create folders (or genres). Within those folders you will be able to make individual files called Wrinkles. It is said when you learn something new you gain an extra wrinkle on your brain. If you have information that you dont want to share publically on the MyBrain app, no worries! you have the option of making your post public so people can learn from your experiences or private for the things you'd like to keep to yourself.

HOW IT WAS MADE MyBrain was created with a Ruby-on-Rails backend SQLite database, and a React, CSS, Bootstrap, HTML front-end. I also used JWIT for user Authentication.

FINAL WORDS Thank you again for checking my project out feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn at https://www.linkedin.com/in/jason-herrera-aka-algorithmicjason/ and go and create yourself some new wrinkles!

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.
